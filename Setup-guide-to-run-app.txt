This application is the client app - so the mobile app itself.
The mobile app is implemented using the react-native framework and expo cli. 

These required steps must be followed in order to run this application.

Step 1. To run the application you will need all the node modules. So to install them run npm install.
Ensure that you have node version 10 and npm version 6 or above.

PLEASE refer to package.json for all the dependencies used in the application. 

Step 2. Make sure that the node_modules/ directory is found in the root directory of the app. 

Step 3. The app is developed using expo client and expo-cli. So ensure that expo-cli is installed on the commandline tools on your chosen operating system.

Step 4. Once everything is installed, you can run npm start (expo start if you have successfully installed expo-cli)  to run the mobile app. It will open a development server which allows you to run the app on the phone/on an emulator.
