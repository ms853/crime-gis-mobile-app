This application serves as the server-side implementation of my mobile application.
The mobile app queries the rest api-endpoint.

These required steps must be followed in order to run this application.

Step 1. To run the application you will need all the node modules. So to install them run npm install.
Ensure that you have node version 10 and npm version 6 or above.

Step 2. Once installed, you can run node index.js to start the server.
(For development purposes, I used npm run dev to start the development environment which creates the server.
